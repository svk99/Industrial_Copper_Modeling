Industrial Copper Modeling

Problem Statement-
The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues
such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually 
can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine learning regression model can address these 
issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging 
algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.

Technologies used-
Python
Streamlit
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Joblib

Approach

1.Apply preprocessing techniques on the dataset like handling null values and treating outliers.
2.Visualize the outliers before and after treating them and also identify the skewness.
3.Encode the categorical variables using suitable method.
4.Build a model to predict the required target variable.
5.Develop streamlit app to allow user to input the data and display the prediction.
